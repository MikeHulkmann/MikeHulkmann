## Working Principles

- Security is not optional.
- No default credentials. No unsafe assumptions.
- Every system must be auditable.
- Isolation before exposure.
- Explicit configuration over implicit behavior.
- Minimal attack surface.
- Reproducible environments.
- Documented architecture.

---

## Interests

- Offensive security research
- Secure backend architecture
- Infrastructure control & self-hosting
- AI system integration
- Lightweight and efficient system design
- Ethical hacking methodology
- Continuous technical refinement

---

## Environment Philosophy

Prefer full control over stack and deployment pipeline.  
Minimal dependencies.  
Explicit configuration.  
Measured complexity.
